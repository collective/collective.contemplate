TODO
====

* Add UI to the types control for selecting a global template

* Add UI to folders for specifying context templates

* Further avoid redundant indexing

  Implement manage_pasteObjects and manage_renameObject, such that no
  indexing is performed and leave indexing to the edit form handling.

  This might cause problems with programmatic use.
